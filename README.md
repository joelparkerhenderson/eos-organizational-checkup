Our 10-year target (i.e. big long-range business goal) is clear, communicated regularly, and is shared by all.

Our target market (i.e. definition of our ideal customer) is clear, and all our marketing and sales efforts are focused on it.

Our 3 Uniques (i.e. differentiators) are clear, and all of our marketing and sales efforts communicate them.

We have a proven process for doing business with our customers; we have named it, and visually illustrated it, and all of our salespeople use it.

All of the people in our organization are the "right people" (i.e. they fit our culture and share our core values).

Our accountability chart (i.e. organizational chart that includes roles and responsibilities) is clear, complete, and constantly updated.

Everyone is in the right seat (i.e. the get it, want it, and have the capacity to do their jobs well).

Our leadership team is open and honest, and demonstrates a high level of trust.

Everyone has 1-7 priorities per quarter and is focused on them.

Everyone is engaged in regular weekly meetings.

All meetings are on the same day and at the same each week, have the same agenda, start on time, and end on time.

All teams clearly identify, discuss, and solves issues for the long-term greater good of the organization.

Processes are documented, simplified, and followed by all to consistently produce the results we want.

We have systems for receiving regular feedback from customers and employees, so we always know their level of satisfaction.

A scorecard for tracking weekly metrics/measurables is in place.

Everyone in the organization has at least one number they are accountable for keeping on track each week.

We have a budget and are monitoring it regularly e.g. monthly or quarterly.
